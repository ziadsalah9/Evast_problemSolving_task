finding distinct elements between two arrays

 1- should first convert the array to list to remove duplicate values;
 2- when iterate the first set should check if the same element in set2 if yes
    ignore it, no add it to the result

    the same thing when iterate the second set

    now i have the result just print it




In first way
I converted both input arrays into Sets to remove duplicates and allow fast lookups.
Then, I filtered elements that exist in the first set but not in the second one.
I repeated the same process in reverse for the second array.
Finally, I returned both results as a list of lists.

In second way
I used stream api to collect data from array into set.
then doing the same thing filtered elements from the first set by second and the opposite.
